A survey app powered by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/), it's still in development, meaning not functional!.

But I want to try it!

    git clone git@github.com:alfonsoperez/redux-survey.git
    cd redux-survey
    npm i
    npm i -g webpack-dev-server
    webpack-dev-server

Now browse to http://localhost:8080 and you're all set

Tests

    npm run test
